# Project 05 – Azure Security Monitoring & Sentinel SIEM

## Overview

This project combines four interconnected labs to build a complete security monitoring pipeline on Azure. Starting from VM deployment and log collection, through threat protection and just-in-time access, all the way to a fully operational SIEM with automated incident response using Microsoft Sentinel.

---

## Tools & Services Used

- Azure Virtual Machines
- Log Analytics Workspace
- Azure Monitor / Data Collection Rules
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud (Servers Plan 2)
- Just-in-Time VM Access
- Microsoft Sentinel
- Azure Logic Apps (Playbooks)

## Lab Breakdown

### Lab 08 – VM, Log Analytics & Data Collection

Set up the monitoring foundation by deploying a VM via PowerShell, creating a Log Analytics workspace, and configuring a Data Collection Rule (DCR) to capture CPU, Memory, Disk, and Network metrics every 60 seconds.

| # | Screenshot | Description |
|---|------------|-------------|
| 1 | ![VM Created](screenshots/01-vm-created.png) | Deployed myVM using PowerShell to be monitored and protected. |
| 2 | ![Log Analytics](screenshots/02-log-analytics-workspace.png) | Created Log Analytics workspace to centralize log collection. |
| 3 | ![Storage Account](screenshots/03-storage-account.png) | Created storage account for diagnostic data. |
| 4 | ![DCR Created](screenshots/04-dcr-created.png) | Created DCR to collect CPU, Memory, Disk, and Network metrics every 60 seconds. |

### Lab 09 – Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 2

Enabled advanced threat protection across the VM environment using Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

| # | Screenshot | Description |

### Lab 10 – Just-in-Time VM Access

Reduced the VM's attack surface by enabling JIT access — limiting open RDP/SSH ports to only when access is explicitly requested and approved.

| # | Screenshot | Description |
|---|------------|-------------|
| 6 | ![JIT Enabled](screenshots/06-jit-enabled.png) | Enabled Just-in-Time VM access to reduce attack surface. |
| 7 | ![JIT Access Granted](screenshots/07-jit-access-granted.png) | Requested and granted temporary JIT access to connect to the VM. |

---

### Lab 11 – Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM + Automated Response)

Deployed Microsoft Sentinel as the SIEM layer, connected data connectors, built analytics rules to detect threats, and created a Logic Apps playbook to automate incident response.

| # | Screenshot | Description |
|---|------------|-------------|
| 8 | ![Sentinel Added](screenshots/08-sentinel-added.png) | Added Microsoft Sentinel to the Log Analytics workspace for full SIEM capabilities. |
| 9 | ![Activity Connector](screenshots/09-activity-connector.png) | Connected Azure Activity data connector to monitor subscription activity. |
| 10 | ![Analytics Rule](screenshots/10-analytics-rule.png) | Created analytics rule to detect suspicious resource creation. |
| 11 | ![Playbook Deployed](screenshots/11-playbook-deployed.png) | Deployed playbook to automate incident severity changes. |
| 12 | ![Custom Alert](screenshots/12-custom-alert-automation.png) | Created custom alert with automated playbook response. |
| 13 | ![Incident Created](screenshots/13-incident-created.png) | Incident detected — Sentinel caught the JIT policy deletion automatically. |

## Key Takeaways

- Built an end-to-end security monitoring pipeline from infrastructure to SIEM
- Configured automated threat detection and response without manual intervention
- Demonstrated how JIT access, Defender, and Sentinel work together as a layered security strategy
- Connected real-world cloud security concepts to a production-style workflow
